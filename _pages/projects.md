On this page, I've shared cool videos of my few projects that I've worked on before.

**Lidar based crowd counting:** 
<span style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I developed a 2D Lidar based crowd counting solution from scratch for Dynamic Crowd Measurement Pty Ltd. I used a 2D lidar with scan frequency>20Hz and applies some mathematical formula and conventional machine learning for counting crowd and its direction. The setup required positioning the Lidar at approximately a 45-degree angle with the ground and at a height of 7-10ft. This system has been successfully deployed at various events worldwide for comprehensive crowd monitoring. . This system was deployed on different event around the world for crowd monitoring. Here is a nice video of this solution [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JID9oJlDthw). The video shows the number of people entering and exiting through a gate over time.</span>

**Similar color multiple object tracking:** 
<span style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This was my Master's thesis project where I created a tracking algorithm using particle filters. It combines visual and motion cues at the same time and adjusts their importance based on how objects interact. Check out this demo to see how it compares to other methods.

**Realtime eye Detection and tracking using webcam:** 
<span style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I worked on this project during my undergradute study. The code was written in C++. I used some image processing and machine learning algorithm to determine eye and iris centers from webcam. Here is a demo of this work [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCM2pUFLr-U).</span>
