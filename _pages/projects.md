Projects
======
On this page, I've shared some neat videos of a few projects I've worked on before.

**Lidar based crowd counting:** 
I developed a 2D Lidar based crowd counting solution from scratch for Dynamic Crowd Measurement Pty Ltd. I used a 2D lidar with scan frequency>20Hz and applies some mathematical formula and conventional machine learning for counting crowd and its direction. The setup required positioning the Lidar at approximately a 45-degree angle with the ground and at a height of 7-10ft. This system has been successfully deployed at various events worldwide for comprehensive crowd monitoring. . This system was deployed on different event around the world for crowd monitoring. Here is a nice video of this solution [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JID9oJlDthw).

**Similar color multiple object tracking:** 
This was my Master thesis work where I developed a particle filter based tracking algorithm that uses both visual and motion cues simultaneously and use a adaptive weight adjustment between cues based on object interactions. Here is a comparative demo of this work [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncCjNF3DdII)

**Realtime eye Detection and tracking using webcam:** 
I worked on this project during my undergradute study. The code was written in C++. I used some image processing and machine learning algorithm to determine eye and iris centers from webcam. Here is a demo of this work [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCM2pUFLr-U).
